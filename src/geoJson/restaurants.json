Last time we were her we got a spot at the bar and that was a cool experience too.\n\nWe loved the signature shrimp appetizer, but it's lost a step. They must have changed the sauce recipe a little. Still good, just not as good as we remembered from 6 years prior (we sort of had beef with Gittos after trying to do a wedding dinner here and finally gave in).\n\nHighly recommend for a date night or other special occasion. Reservations help, but we always end up getting seated in under an hour without. Beer selection is solid.",

We each ordered an entree and shared an appetizer, and we could barely take a bite of the dessert by the time we got to it. This is definitely a special occasion kind of place for most couples and families with more affordable spots elsewhere on the Hill, but we had a 10/10 experience and I look forward to going back one day!",

The salmon pasta was just alright - the pasta was basically butter noodles but the salmon was cooked perfectly! The pizza had a thicker crust and the mozzarella was yummy on it!\nThe desserts were the perfect way to end the night (tiramisu and dark chocolate raspberry cheesecake from Hank's) - they definitely stole the show!",

We did feel grotesquely under dressed and chose not to check our coats because of this. Therefore, we were ushered to the very back room with the rest of the under dressed, coat wearing crowd. I understand they have a dress code which would have been nice to know ahead of time so we didn\u2019t get treated like second class citizens they were embarrassed of. Our waiter, however was very attentive and did an excellent job. The floor manager (I think) came to check on us and the food quality a couple times. I\u2019d definitely go back for the food!!",

My wife had the sampler platter and some sort of creamy cake with a caramel sauce.  The food came out very quickly and it was all delicious; I wish I could eat more. The food here was really, really good.  The decor is fun, Cajun-quirky with a lot of musically-themed artifacts (they have live music 7 days a week).  There's a bit of cool history here, too - some of the original building from 1843 is still in use.  Maybe my new favorite restaurant in St. Louis.  Will definitely return!",

It\u2019s the place to go if you want to take guests when they visit from out of town. Or if you just want to hang out at the bar and have a nice drink. They also have an outstanding patio.

It really meant a lot to me that he thoroughly communicated with me throughout my reservation process, at the initial greeting, leading up to the meal, during the meal and at close. I had fantastic service during my entire experience.\n\nI was seated at the bar.  Danielle was working at the bar and made my experience very worth while.  The wine som that goes between their restaurants was also there that night and it added a lot to the meal. She talked about pairings and the wine itself and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThere are a lot of things pictured. I tried to capture how it was placed in front of me...and then I moved things together them in the same frame. I enjoyed everything in the app round.  The pork was the only thing I wasn't thrilled about on the second round... I wish I had more room in my body to finish the corn. It was delicious. Everything was delicious. The elegance and decor were phenomenal.  I highly recommend this experience",

Very interesting varieties to f wine. Food\u2026it is possible that we got not into the best week, but why should any week be better or worse than the other. Chef has a strong romance with balsamic reduction & vinegar of one kind or another. It was everywhere..completely overpowering the whole pattern: in three out of five snacks (appetisers - beets, squash, mushroom tacos), in main course- carrots, chicken, salad, and\u2026.tam tam tam, wait for it, even the desert\u2026We picked pescatarian menu first, but was convinced to open my options for no restrictions menu. Disappointed as having chicken next day after thanksgiving is not what I thought Chef\u2019s choice was going to be. My favourite plates were the bread from Winslow, radish with pesto, pear in prosciutto, rice that came with main course.",

The experience was like a stream of tapas all evening long so I didn't leave stuffed. Each appetizer was unique in flavor, but the combination of plates offered never competed with the flavors of the others. The food preparation was a feast for the palate as well as the eyes! I recommend sampling something from the cocktail menu as well! The staff is very personable and knowledgeable...they truly know how to make this a beautiful and comfortable experience! I highly recommend Vicia and can't wait to visit again!",

The dill pickle soup was surprisingly delicious and really did pair well with the Cuban sandwich. For drinks I had the bees knees, love potion No. 9 and the espresso martini. Everything exceeded expectations and I very much look forward to going back\n\nI went back and it was just as amazing as the first time. This time Andrew was taking care of us and was so friendly and energetic. We started with a piping hot spinach and artichoke dip that was super creamy and cheesey. I had the birdseed salad with chicken and was pecking on that while I enjoyed four fabulous drinks. Still my favorite place in St Louis and I loved the Soap Hospital in the booth.",

The service was outstanding. I could not have asked for a better experience with the couple of staff members I interacted with, they were knowledgable, respectful, funny, & just great at what they do. Now the food was next level. My fianc\u00e9e & I ordered 2 starters, a small plate (that was bigger than small), & the pork chop. We loved every single dish. Everything was perfectly seasoned & cooked. We were about 90% done & were absolutely stuffed, but we unbuttoned our pants and fought the good fight. 10/10 & will be one of my first stops when I come back to St Louis.",

NEVER would have stumbled on the Little Fox, but someone gave us a gift certificate and I am so happy they did.   We walked in and the place was hip and cozy with a ton of positive energy.  There are two large rooms, the front one has an incredible bar.  Do not miss having a cocktail especially one of their original creations.  We had the Love Shack and The Transaction Report both a play on popular cocktails.  For food we started with the Gem Salad which was beautifully presented, perfectly dressed and best of all Chilled.  It was perfectly cold like a salad should be.  We then had the Cannellini Crostini.  I am not one for \"bruschetta\" but this was one with outstanding taste and texture.  We then had the Bolognese Bianco which was served with a bucatini a great choice of pasta with the texture to hold up to the rich, meaty sauce.  We finished with the Blueberry Cake which I highly recommend as well.  Service was outstanding which is such an important part of dining out.  We were splitting everything as we like to try as many things as we can and they cut the Crostini in half and even split a glass of wine which was incredibly thoughtful but not necessary.  My only issue was the first course came out blazingly fast and we had barely taken the first sip from our cocktails and would have liked 5-10 minutes of enjoying my cocktail before eating.  I CANNOT wait to go back.  Thank you for a wonderful evening.",

It was my wife's birthday and in my reservation (having not been familiar with the establishment) I requested a window seat and pre-arranged birthday dessert. Well being on the lower level, there were zero window seats, but the manager, Daniel, took great care of us. He sat us at a mirror section, which was the best alternative. Our service was amazing and food was delicious. Absolutely the best steak and potatoes I've had to date. The birthday dessert was complimentary and my wife loved it as well. I will be back and have already recommended Lombardo's to multiple family members while having after dinner cocktails. Thanks for a great birthday dinner for my wife. Daniel even took pictures of us together for her birthday photo memories!\n\nExcellent job!",

We've been 100% ok with the sort of quirky way this restaurant has been run, and have generally loved the food. Our last meal, however, was a huge disappointment. Our daughter was in town from college and we took her out to celebrate. The apps (and wine) were excellent, but the main course (ribs) were IMO inedible. They were both tough and so salted it was akin to some kind of thick jerky. None of us ate more than one bite. We had tickets at the Fox that night, so we really didn't have time to try for a replacement dish. I figured I'd call the restaurant, let them know the experience, and they'd make it right. So I called the following week. Never got a call back. Since they have a unique schedule, I thought I'd go the extra mile and just share my experience via email (to their general info inbox). Again, no reply. They pop up in my Insta fee a LOT, so I KNOW they are active on Insta. I sent them a quick \"I bet you didn't see the email\" message on Insta...again...nothing. We won't be back. A $200 life lesson for me.",

The service was very good and we consistently got each pairing with the food (albeit a couple minutes after the food came each time). I would have loved to hear from our server why they paired each wine with the dish.\n\nThe food itself was also very good, just the right size portions to make you full at the end without being stuffed. We loved the pappardelle, salmon tartare and chocolate dessert most! One minor suggestion is to use more acidity in the dishes throughout to make them pop.

Yes, really.\n\nI ordered the spicy tofu wrap (on a tortilla, unfortunately) with spicy eggplant and an order of mushroom dumplings. The tofu wrap was good, tortilla and all. Delicious blend of flavors with the spice, the cilantro, the sweet cabbage... I could eat that every day. I bet it's even better on rice paper. \ud83d\ude1d\n\nThe dumplings were also addictive. Savory, with a spicy sauce. Either item probably would have been enough on their own.\n\nI appreciated the dedication to minimizing waste by setting chopsticks aside to be washed and reused. I'm not clear on the wisdom of serving everything on butcher paper, but okay. \ud83e\udd37 I'll be back another day to try the rice paper.",

The stir fried veggie was bok choy, which I liked, and the spicy eggplant was okay. My husband really enjoyed his Thai chicken wrap.\n\nThe only real drawback for me is that they don't seem to know what to do with a kid's palate. We talked about using plain tofu, which I got and enjoyed, but my kid's plate had spicy tofu. It's pretty dang spicy, and she just couldn't eat it. He very nicely agreed to bring out non-spicy tofu, but unfortunately it was soaked in some very strong soy sauce. Also, note that even though they have a kid's section on the menu, they apparently don't really have a kid's menu. He mentioned that, but I guess I didn't understand that the \"tofu\" in that section was the same as the \"spicy tofu\" on another part of the menu. All this to say: be very explicit if you have strong preferences or dietary needs, particularly if you have a finicky eater in the group.",

They say about themselves \"Thai with a twist\", which is true.\nWe stopped by on a Thursday evening, the place was not too crowded and we could choose our table ourselves, which was nice. We had a couple of questions concerning the menu and the waitress explained it all very friendly to us.\nSo we had the vegetarian garden spring rolls as a starter and afterwards the red curry with chicken and also a yellow curry, which was on the special menu. The food is freshly prepared, good sized portions and most important delicious.\nAs drinks we had the Thai Ice Tea, also great, especially with the Thai food.\nLast not least I'd like to mention, that the atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice, very bright, open and airy.\nDefinitely 5*",

The food would have recieved five stars had the chicken in the curry dish not been too dry and lacking flavor.  The apps were good, and fried items cooked at the right temp, so not too oily.  The menu is simple, but I am guessing that due to lack of labor to complete preparations the night before, they were out of several menu items  when I arrived at opening for lunch. So that was a bit disappointing.",

The crab rangoon were savory, which is exactly what I hope for in a rangoon. The Tom yum was delicious, they say clear broth but if you've ever had an actual clear (no haze no red) Tom yum that isn't what this is. All the same I would order it all again if I didn't have so many things on the menu I want to try. I definitely recommend this place if you like Thai food.",

They also have a well rounded of cocktails and beer, I always enjoy the plum wine. And they do offer happy hour specials, a kids menu and dessert menu.\n\nDuring happy hour I\u2019d expect to spend $10-$25, my meal here I was exceptionally hungry so appetizer, entree, sushi, drink = $51. And service was exceptional very intuitive in my experience and was very knowledgeable with the questions involving sake and unfamiliar menu items for my experience.",

                        "text": "I found out about this restaurant through a friend via Facebook. He had a friend gathering there and I saw the layout of the place and pictures of the food. I was instantly intrigued and happy to see that it was an Asian Bistro. I hadn't been to one in a while since my favorite one, Tani Sushi Bistro had closed in Clayton a few years ago.\n\nI decided that I needed to check out this place and brought my mother along with me. We arrived around 2:30pm and were immediately seated. It was busy so we got there at a great time. We looked over the menu and decided on the following items:\n\nDrinks:\nPlum Blossom (Me)\nHot tea (Mom)\n\nAppetizers:\nThai Spring Rolls\nCrab Rangoon\n\nMain course:\nPineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp\nThree Kings with Shrimp\nTempura Fried JB Roll\nOriental Fried Rice with Chicken\n\nOur drinks first came out along with glasses of water. I swirled my drink around before taking the first sip and it was delicious! The Plum Blossom drink consists of Plum Wine mixed with Club Soda and Chambord liqueur. It had the perfect mix of sweet and carbonation. I had to stop myself from drinking it all up so quickly.\n\nMy mom informed me that she was pleased with her hot tea.\n\nThen our appetizers came out. I tried a Thai Spring Roll and it was so light and fluffy! When I bit into the roll it felt like crispy paper. Yet the flavor was definitely there. It didn't feel oily like I'm used to getting an egg roll from a Chop Suey restaurant. The Sweet and Sour dipping sauce also complimented the rolls perfectly.\n\nThe other appetizer was Crab Rangoon. The texture was a bit more crispy on these but I'm used to that when it comes to this dish. What really sold me though was the cream cheese mixture of crab, green onion, and bell pepper. The seasoning for this had just the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering.\n\nFinally our main courses came out and I immediately tried a piece of my JB Roll. In other sushi bistro restaurants in Saint Louis normally this dish is called a Philly Roll. It consists of Salmon, cream cheese and avocado. Normally when I order this roll I have them hold the avocado and I request for it to be tempura-fried. I also ask for extra eel sauce to dip my roll.\n\nOn my first bite I knew I had found my new favorite place to enjoy sushi. The size of the ingredients in the roll were just right. It didn't feel mushy and it didn't look rushed. It was absolutely perfect. I enjoyed a few more pieces before moving on to my Pineapple Fried Rice.\n\nNow onto my Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp......when I took my first bite I feel as though I should have been enjoying this on a beach. This did not have the greasy taste that one might find from a Chop Suey joint. This rice was so fresh. It reminds me of the Japanese styled steakhouses that prepare the food in front of you. It just tasted that fresh. The Pineapples in the dish were complimented with raisins, cashews, egg, green onion, white onion, and carrots and garlic. When I tell you this is by far the BEST fried rice I have ever encountered...I am not saying that lightly.\n\nMy mother was very please with her Three Kings dish. She said the seasoning was perfect and she did like snapping the fried noodles into her dish.\n\nI also decided to get a dish to go for my father which was Oriental Fried Rice with Chicken. He let me know that he thought the dish was amazing.\n\nThe only negative I have about the experience was about parking. Yet that is not a reflection on the restaurant at all. For myself I was able to find a parking spot right across from the restaurant which I count as a blessing. Because normally parking downtown sucks.\n\nOverall the food here was excellent and I definitely will be revisiting again.",

Without hesistation, he gave us Syberg's as an answer for a nearby sports bar in the city. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with the atmosphere of where locals come to watch the game if they couldn't make it into the stadiums down the street. St. Louis sports memoribilia, neon bar signs and wide screen TVs adorn the walls, making sports and beer the primary focuses of the bar.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't worth going for the food: We tried their in-house Whiskey sauced wings, that had a good crispy outer skin and a tangy, finger licking aftertaste. I enjoyed the Open-faced French Dip (without provolone, not too much of a cheese guy) on a toasted garlic roll. The au jus dip was savory, and I wish I soaked my sandwich in it more than I had.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to local and traveller alike, and try to visit on a game day! We had stopped in during their trivia night, which still seemed like a fun time. We ended up kind of playing along as we ate.\n\nActual Rating: 5/5\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5\nFood: 5/5\nService: 4.5/5",

They will give you a glass of ice to go with it. I\u2019m not sure about \u201crefills\u201d but someone else in my party had a can of Coke and when she finished it, the waitress brought her another one immediately.

If you can, get their tartare, and order the polenta with whatever else is going to make you happy. Either (or both) salad and soup (creamy and flavorful squash soup! Amen!) will make you glad you chose them. The brisket is smoky and falls apart in the very best way. The scallops are tender and tasty. The dessert items and accompanying libations are a wonderful and worth it splurge. On your own, or a small party without a reservation? Try sitting at the bar, where the bartenders are ready with interesting conversation and insightful menu suggestions. 11/10 on a scale of 10.",

Nestled near Benton park/ Soulard area - a nondescript building from outside but as soon as you enter, the brick walls, the bar area and stand and can lighting will appeal sophistication. We had Westley as server and he was 5 star all the way. They have elaborate wine and liquor selection and they can even make some great mock tails on the fly. It\u2019s cozy atmosphere but very good utilization of space and service is fast. You won\u2019t go wrong with Lobster turnover or Veal dumplings for starters. Entree and A la carte dishes have great choices - if you are going for A la carte dish then a  salad (try the apple salad- it was one of the most delicious part of the meal) or soup and side dish is highly recommended as portion sizes are small - but love the plating! Don\u2019t skip the desert menu and if you are adventurous go for the Espresso martin. Definitely coming here again!!",

The food is a little pricey, but....the ingredients were all very fresh, were cooked well, and the portions were plentiful.  We both got small plates, main dishes, and drinks, and our bill was still only $110 for 2 people (even with a $39 fish dish and $12 glass of wine).  The apple salad was large enough to be an entree.  The service was fantastic!  Best we've had in a while.  The server was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list and which would pair well with the food.  If you asked where the restroom was, they'd walk you there.  If someone was leaving, they'd open the door for them.  All were masked up as well.  The pace was right.  The music was even perfect for the ambiance.   This is a must-try restaurant!  Do make reservations, though, because they don't have a ton of tables.",

They have nice outdoor seating, but I dined inside. Absolutely beautiful, vibey atmosphere with good music. I took my 12 yr old son, so they are kid friendly as well. Food delivered to your table keeping presentation in mind, and it was all delicious!",

                        "text": "A fine dining soul seafood experience in landlocked Saint Louis- definitely one of the best for special nights (or a family brunch)- may remind you a bit of NOLA. Thoughtful decoration, amazing always smiling wait staff and a hard working General Manager Mr Thurman makes this place a shining star in CWE neighborhood. Reservation is highly recommend, finding parking on street may be sometime tough so plan accordingly. It took them some time to get us to our table even though we had reservation but once seated our server Aliyah made the experience amazing! Nice selection of craft cocktails, liquors and wine will complement the very creative artistic small plates and main courses. Beside the seafood menu they have very thoughtfully created vegetable dishes such as Carrot three ways, Flash fried Brussels! Duck Rangoon was great - wish it came more than just three in a plate. Some of the popular dishes such as whole fried Caribbean red snapper are a feast for the eye! Main course food portions are huge. Alligator tacos had a spicy touch!! The reason for my 4 star review is that even though we were party of three they had 4 guests listed in our bill and added 20% gratuity with additional suggested tip\u2026so double check the bill-otherwise everything was great and definitely returning back!!",

Some restaurants bring to plate more than just the food, and it is one of them. Great indoor and outdoor space with relaxed atmosphere dining but a perfect place for a date night as well. Our server Lauren was pleasant with a big smile and explained the menu very well. Has great selection of beverage including NA cocktails. Selection of Apps as well as Entree is limited but very unique and earthy to taste. Little Gem, potato fritters came in good shareable size. Halibut was very fresh and one of the best I have in STL. Has a great selection of liquors/desert/espresso to end your meal. Will come back again- have heard good things about the breakfast and brunch!!",

The decor is stunning, with half of the space looking like a mysterious forest where I think they sell flowers and greenery. The other half is the restaurant in a monochrome, neutral design. Mostly white with black floors and beige accents.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a pomegranate margarita which she loved. When our food came it out, it was really hit or miss. Our honey nut squash was pretty undercooked. Same with the cauliflower. We were pretty disappointed\u2026 yet, they made it it up with the entrees. We got the chicken and steak. The meats were practically perfect, but again the potatoes were undercooked. We loved the sauces, the flavor profiles were masterfully put together by the chef.\n\nOverall, it was really nice, but we were disappointed with half of our food.",

I like the sauce they created for every dish, just right to make the dish interesting but not overpower the main ingredients. The fish was fantastic to me, normally Restaurants use filets but they choose to present it with whole fish; it was well seasoned and tender. This is the best trout I have in St. Louis.\n\nThe desserts are good but I felt a bit heavy.\n\nI hope this restaurant can hold up this quality after its expansion this summer. \ud83d\ude4f please.",

It's so soft, fresh,  fragrant, and chewy. The honey oil elevated it so much!!! The filling was also amazing. Plenty of it. And the garlic butter to dip it in put it OVER THE TOP.\n\nI was obsessed. I was supposed to save it for my plane ride home but it never even made it to the airport.\n\nIf I ever come back to St. Louis, this is it. I won't go anywhere else. I must return. Amazing.",

The next time we go to redeem our meal which they only replaced one calzone because they couldn\u2019t find they order replacement book. The caller was rude and asked did we call back after the order was messed up again, not only did we call we kept them. The label didn\u2019t match what should\u2019ve been in the box. The rudest person I\u2019ve ever met in a customer service environment. I will not return here and won\u2019t recommend. The  Calzone was half done and very greasy. Very displeased",

We hit the pep rally in Ballpark Village and then hit Quattro for lunch before the gates opened at the stadium.\nWe sat at the bar.  The place was busy, but not packed.  The service was just a tad slow, (because they were busy) but attentive.\nWe both had burgers and fries, and great conversations with other Cardinals fans from elsewhere who were there for the same reasons.\nMy burger was cooked to perfection the way I wanted it.  The fries were generous and quite enough, and quite delicious.\nHaving lunch here was a very nice highlight of my whole experience of attending my first Cardinals home opener.\nI certainly would like to visit your establishment again.",

I started off with the Toasted Ravioli ($8) with marinara sauce and it came out quick. It was sprinkled with parmesan cheese and tasted good. My only recommendation would be to cook them for one minute less, so they do not come out softer.\n\nI also ordered the Pollo Panini ($14), a grilled chicken breast, with baby spinach, heirloom tomato, fontina, and pesto. The sandwich was solid, good taste, and could have used more pesto. However, the side... a fennel and orange slaw, was tremendous! Never had anything like it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would have ordered a couple more sides!\n\nOverall, this was a good restaurant that served its purpose, coupled to a hotel. You can come down for a convenient, good meal for lunch or dinner.",

My $4 coffee was never refilled, had to ask twice to have water refilled, and even asked to have our order canceled since it was taking so long. Once we asked to cancel, they quickly started making the order (you can see the cooks from the table). When my wife asked about my daughter\u2019s Cheerios, the waitress rolled her eyes at her. Then I noticed the bill had a 25% gratuity added to it. I would recommend going somewhere else if you\u2019re staying at the Westin. Not the type of food or service I expected.

The food was top-tier, and they have some really inventive selections. The wild mushroom pizza was one of the best wood-fired pizzas I\u2019ve had. The duck egg on top really took it to the next level. The bucatini was legitimately one of the best pasta dishes I\u2019ve ever had. The calamari was amazing, and don\u2019t sleep on the fries. They also had their own Private Select Four Roses single barrel, and make a delicious old fashioned. I can only give 5 stars, but I would like to give more.",

Definitely should have a number to reach someone at all times during open business hours, given that they're open til 3am. However, that's not enough to keep me from going back for another fun night at this great spot.",

The \"Chilean Seabass\" is probably cod.\n\nI read the reviews of this place, and I wish I'd listened, but we ate here because we were staying in the hotel. The bartenders were friendly and skilled--the cocktails were excellent, yet overpriced. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned that was $19. I'd do it again, but with a different bourbon next time. For my meal, I ordered the Chilean seabass. I've had it many times, and I know what to expect in terms of texture and taste. Honestly, I think the fish I was served was cod because the texture of the fish was wrong--it was firm like cod, not soft and flaky like Chilean seabass. The entr\u00e9e was also really oily.  I definitely plan to go back to the hotel and have drinks at the bar (with less expensive bourbon), but I don't plan to eat there ever again.",

The bread was crisp and buttery but soft on the inside to perfection. I could have passed on the homemade chips and dip but I was really hungry do I wanted to get at it! The drinks were pretty good and unique. I will go again and try there other menu items. Of course with the fries. The atmosphere was clean. Bathroom was clean. Very nice Benton Park view.",

No reservations accepted but it has ample indoor and great patio space as well as bar seating area to enjoy some fresh lobster, cram, oysters etc. Servers are excellent and service is pretty fast. We got some raw Oysters from Massachusetts as starters and it was excellent. Lot of other choices of Poor boy shrimp, crawfish etc sandwiches as well as Crab rolls etc. Wine list by the glass or bottle is good and some great cocktail choices are there to enjoy. If you still have room then end your meal with some home made shareable desserts/pies. An excellent experience overall and one of the top recommended restaurants dirty your hand!!",

Our server Nate was patient and answered our questions throughly with each course. We took 90 minutes to enjoy several selections. We were never rushed. You should expect to more for a wonderful meal like this, however it was worth the price. I give my top recommendation.",

This eatery is tucked into the historic Benton Park neighborhood, offering high quality, fresh seafood at its finest.\n\nWe ordered the Lobster Roll (Connecticut style); served on a warm, buttery bun with delicious pieces of tender lobster and chips on the side. The Shrimp Boil is a feast on its\u2019 own! This plate is served with a generous amount of shrimp, steamed potatoes, corn and a house-made biscuit. The seafood boils are enough for two! The raw oysters and peel & eat shrimp are a must try, as well.\n\nPeacemaker is a little on the expensive side, but entirely worth it. The service is exceptional and the team offers great recommendations. The cocktails are crafted with great ingredients and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. If you haven\u2019t stopped by Peacemaker, you are missing out!",

The side of chips were nice and seasoned with a good hint of spice. The shrimp po boy tasted fresh and came hot. The lobster Mac and cheese could use some work. Noodles need about one minute more to cook and the cheese sauce needs to be thickened up to give it that unctuous feel. The drinks were quite tasty and strong like I like it. Definitely will be back over and over",

We put our name on the waitlist and were told it will be a 25 minute wait but it really took only 16 minutes for us to be seated. The wait staff were very busy. We needed refills and it took a while for our waitress to reappear so we could ask her for some.\n\nI originally ordered a lemonade to drink and it tasted like lemon flavored water. I ended up switching it for a sprite. Maybe the syrup was low. I didn\u2019t investigate it, so don\u2019t be afraid to try it for yourself. I saw a child drinking it with no problems.\n\nOur food was delicious. We had the Smash burger (it comes with seasoned waffle fries) and a chicken fried steak meal (it came with mashed potatoes & carrots). I would come back for the burger & fries for sure. My teenager (a young lady of few words) said her meal was good and was looking forward to eating her leftovers for dinner. Not Pictured: We also ordered a Gooey Butter cake to-go. It was just okay. Not like any other one we had before. It tasted like maybe it had too much extract flavor. It wasn\u2019t nasty but it wasn\u2019t for me.\n\nRecap: I\u2019ll be back for sure. There were several appetizers we want to try. The menu has something for everyone. Our bill was $60 for the 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 1 dessert.",

We come back whenever we can. So glad to see it reopened after 2 long years.  The food was delicious(seasoned perfectly),but we were disappointed they didn't do brunch anymore. Also there was nowhere in the reservation to put it was our anniversary so there wasn't anything special like past years.",

My friends & I made reservations with enough time to explore the amazing Kehinde Wiley & Graphic Revolution exhibits today.\n\nBrandy was an ok server; nothing to complain about nor write home. It was pretty straight to the point (order, deliver, check).\n\nWe all drink lol...so Chardonnay & Ros\u00e9 domed the table. I opted for the Grilled Eggplant entree. A lovely tower of perfectly grilled thick sliced eggplant,  forest mushrooms, quinoa, sweet red peppers, goat cheese & basil mint oil. It was delicious. My dining companions ordered the Quiche of the day & Ceasar salad. Both were pleased with presentation & taste.\n\nThe dining room is spacious, open & offers a wonderful view overlooking Forest Park's Art Hill.  Fresh roses, heavy silverware & linen napkins were the place setting. Coat check, hostess stand, covered parking are available for those wondering.",

We made a reservation via phone a few days before, and had no problem getting in.  The bar area has a handful of tables as well as bar seating.  The main dining area has a few more tables, and the decor is quite spartan.  I'd expected a bit more ambiance, but it wasn't awful.\n\nFarmhaus is no kidding farm to table, yet the prices are still more than reasonable.  The summer salad was very well balanced, consisting of an array of flavors.  The ribeye was massive, perfectly cooked, and full of flavor; the green beans and mashed sweet/russet potatoes were perfection as well.  The red snapper and polenta was good, but didn't have the same 'wow' (or price) factor as the ribeye.\n\nThis place has been on the Top 100 for at least a couple years, and it's no wonder why.",

Oysters vary depending on source. Ballpark village needed a place like this. I would definitely go back. The bar was quiet, which is a nice change of pace if you need some respite from noisy bars and want to have conversation.",

I have a really cool gas fireplace in there high top tables, low top tables they got a little couch section because it is part of a hotel. The bartenders are really great. The cocktails are mixed wonderfully, and the food is also very good. We got the tuna tartare, a charcuterie, board, some french fries, and a couple other items to share, and they were all very yummy.\n\nThis place definitely does give more upscale fives and the price is sort of reflect that but it is a nice hotel and makes you feel kind of fancy!\n\nYou gotta check this place out for dinner sometime never really cool patio to that's right across the street from Busch Stadium so it might be a good place to pregame a baseball match.",

The tiger rolls were perfect, and the wild caught bass was seasoned wonderfully. The drinks were fun and the socialista offered several layers of great flavor. Dessert was decadent as it should be. This was definitely one of the best dining spots we've been to in a year. Do make a reservation and definitely stop in.",

I viewed the menu and some of the food items and thought, \"this is my type of restaurant.\" And to my surprise, it was... the Tiger Roll with the cilantro jam was EVERYTHING\u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0b the grapefruit was delicious and the Libations were great as well. The only thing I think needs to be revamped is the chicken and waffles. I get that they may have been going for a Southern Chicken and Waffle feel where the crust looks almost burned but the chicken is Juicy on the inside... but it was definitely not that experience. After sending it back and getting the replaced order it was still not tasty. It was dry and overcooked each time the crust was way too crispy and beef jerky chewy. The waffle needs a little bit more weight to it, it was as if I was eating the air.. it was too lightweight and crispy. Other than that, I will definitely go back.",

It is a great restaurant if you have not had any middle eastern food before. I wish appetizer size could be smaller or even have combo( three or four in one plant) then I could have more taste with the bread. Nana bread is delicious! PS, lemonade with mint( I guess the mint is not fresh mint. Maybe it's dry mint) is nice.",

The place is mostly family owned with relatives waiting at tables. The people who interfaced with us were surprisingly very rude. They made us wait a long time and sit at a table we didn't want and then while ordering straight up told us they don't have majority of the menu. No apology or courtesy. The food came quickly and well made. Hummus was given extremely less quantity. Falafel were fine. Curries were very similar in taste. Taste was good though. Non veg pulao was really good. Veg pulao was tasteless. Wings were a joke. You better wings in street fairs. Overall the food was decent enough, and well presented, so giving it 4 stars. Next time i would rather take out than sit and eat. Not a good experience for dining.",

We were quickly greeted and seated by a host and our waitress arrived promptly. She was extremely nice and great at explaining dishes and giving recommendations but not overbearing. Two glasses of house champagne (which was great) were brought to our table by a friendly bartender who wished us a Happy Anniversary. Everything we had was divine and I would highly recommend this place if you like creative food and a cool vibe.",

Our server Johnathon made us feel welcome and at home from the first moment. He gave us wonderful recommendations, since this was our first visit, and he was right in everyone. We did the five-course experience and every plate was cooked to perfection. I would go back for a full dish of any of them, but also wouldn't want to miss trying something new! I will have a very hard time choosing my next meal at Blood & Sand. Fabulous drinks as well, I love that they are named after song titles. Very lively and fun. We can't wait to visit again.",

We ordered drinks and hoped to have 2-3. After we ordered and got our drinks, we waited 45 minutes before we finally left money on the table and left. The waitress stopped at every table around us asking their needs, getting checks, etc., but never once stopped at our table again.",

The pretzel were not pretzel they used numbed shaped pizza dough brushed with butter and no salt and they did not even taste good",

We most definitely will be returning and recommending! Bravo!",

Their mix of beers range in types, ABV and locality. You can order 4oz glasses if you\u2019re into trying several. Their wine selection is also pretty varied, and we enjoyed everything we tried. If you\u2019re hungry make sure to try one of the starters. I recommend the mushroom p\u00e2t\u00e9 if they\u2019re currently serving it. Their other entr\u00e9e dishes have a great blend of flavors. Many of the dishes leveraged flavorful proteins like duck sausage or braised pork belly with savory root veggies and herbs. The ambiance has a refined but rustic feel, and the intimate lighting makes it great for dates or just relaxing with a drink. The bartenders are really friendly and we\u2019re a pleasure to talk to. Prices vary drink-to-drink, but they\u2019re pretty reasonable for downtown.\nI highly recommend stopping by if you haven\u2019t, and we plan to make them a pretty regular stop.",

It was nice but perfectly seared. The potatoes flavored well too. The asparagus too. Like I said 10/10 experience.\n\nMy date had the lasagna. It was so much food! After eating mine and some of his of course \ud83d\ude09, I was stuffed but happy! The food you can never go wrong with.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss these drinks. I don\u2019t normally like ordering drinks because they\u2019re too strong but the drinks here were just right! I ended up drinking two and having a merry time! I don\u2019t like to drink because of taste but I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to order a drink here ever!

I started off with their fried ravioli and I can say it was the best I have had to date! Most places have cheese but these were filled with meat and it was seasoned so well.  I was able to order off menu and they were gracious enough to make Cacio e pepe for me. It's a simple dish but can be easy to mess up if you don't know what you are doing. It turned out great so I give them extra points for going above to take care of their customers.",

We honestly didn\u2019t have to ask once for a refill on chips and salsa and they made us feel so comfortable and kept us filled! The chips and salsa here are sooo good - the salsa is a bit on the spicier side but I love that!\nWe got the El Mireko and Fajitas Rancheros - both were delicious, 100% would get the El Mireko again! The chicken on the Fajitas was really good, had a nice char too - we just weren\u2019t expecting it to be so soupy but the stew (?) it was in was really good! Very tomato-ey\n\nOverall such a great local spot in Soulard!",

It bought back a lot of great memories.\n\nWe walked in, went down the stairs as instructed to check-in. We told a 10 minute wait and we would receive a text. The text never came so about 15 minutes later, we checked in again and they had trouble finding our name. However, the host still took care of us and had us seated.\n\nOnce seated, it was obvious that they were short staffed. I watched as people scrambled back and forth to serve their customers. However, our waiter Terry provided EXCELLENT customer service.\n\nI ordered the Meat Lover\u2019s Treat which is spaghetti. meatballs and Sicilian sausage. I will warn that this is an Italian restaurant and without the meat, the spaghetti is only sauce and noodles which is bland. That dish is about $16 and your meal is finished with ice cream. I attached a copy of the menu but it is very low light. Feel free to zoom in on the menu",

We had a big group and if I am remembering correctly our orders were all right.",

I\u2019m not sure if our server was new, but the waters took 20 mins, didn\u2019t receive our bread or salad until she came around 20 mins later asking do you want more bread, and we had informed her. Once we got the salad, our entree came out 2 mins after so we couldn\u2019t even start the salad and now there\u2019s plates shoved for us. Bread seemed stale, forgot the meatballs, had to correct it. Overall not a great experience, won\u2019t go again.\n\nPros of the experience: noodles were cooked to perfection.

The seating is limited, unless there is more somewhere I didn't see which is possible. They run the front with a bartender/server. What I could see one cook, a lady at that. (which I love to see) No complaints here, bartender/manager? was on his game pre bussing and having tables wiped down as soon as the table was checked out and gone.\n\nLet's talk food. OMG!! First things first, we WILL be back!! The burger... all I had was a single and it is MASSIVE one pound!! I like a good chair broiled burger, but for being a flat top burger phenominal. Steak fries!! And the wings, come breaded or non can be bought individually. DELICIOUS. Kids pizza is the best kids pizza I've had ANYWHERE and if you follow me you know we are a family that likes to eat so we know.\n\nGreat place.",

I would have given them 5 stars except I felt for almost $5 an order, they could have given more onion rings, which were btw, delicious, some of the best I've tasted.

They're obviously not ready yet, bar needs stocked and the space is still getting prepped.  Tried a beef and chicken philly.  Fries great, side salad HUGE, Phillies were a little dry but excellent the next day.  Can't wait to try some other menu items and hope they keep the kitchen open late on game days.",

I ordered gyoza, California roll and spring rolls. The spring rolls were the best part of the meal. Very crispy and well made. The sweet dipping sauce was a perfect pairing. The dumplings were good as well. The sushi was okay. The imitation crab was not great. Not to mention one person at my table had hair in her food. A couple of orders were wrong. If you're looking for a place with fast, dependable service, this is definitely not the place to go. And hopefully your dish doesn't have hair \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I imagine The fountain of youth tastes just like this. Like.. I be looking for that taste in every restaurant. If the water is good, you know the food is gonna BUSSSS.\n\nEverything is good about this place. I\u2019ve had the ramen everytime I\u2019ve went and it\u2019s so spicy and good! Great flavor. I\u2019ve had the chicken and the beef. The chicken is my favorite tho. That broth was just impeccable.\n\nI didn\u2019t like that I read that the ramen noodles were like the thin noodles you get in a .20 cent pack at the grocery and that\u2019s false. These are thicker than those. Thick enough. They\u2019re not the thicker ramen noodles I\u2019ve had at other places BUT are they better? ABSOLUTELY. I get extremely full before I finish my bowl so that\u2019s all that matters.\n\nWhen food makes you happy and hopeful all of a sudden after eating you know it\u2019s good. This place definitely brings bliss and they have amazing prices!!\n\nI had the rainbow roll too. Delicious. Fresh. I added eel sauce. I was SO full.",

The music was loud and bumping and it was very crowded. Ppl were outside trying to get in but they were full. (Get a reservation. I got right in.) They even checked my ID at the door.

                        "text": "Definitely a college scene. They check IDs to enter however they had little kids in high chairs at the table. I came for brunch for a party of 11 which was a disaster. We waited forever for one of the large parties to leave but they stayed beyond the two hour limit and so we were told we\u2019d get two tables close together which ended up being two tables on opposite ends of the dining area. The music was so loud it probably wouldn\u2019t have mattered if we were seated close together because you can\u2019t hear anything.  The food wasn\u2019t worth the wait and could definitely use some seasoning. I ordered the brunch burger which for some reason it\u2019s Canadian Bacon or no bacon at all because you can\u2019t sub for regular bacon. Our waitress gave us dirty silverware with a hair on it and never came back to check on us. The bottomless mimosas are the one redeeming quality. I paid like $50 total for a basic brunch. I don\u2019t mind the 20% automatic gratuity but if you\u2019re going to do that make sure the service and the food is up to par. I\u2019ve had better meals at Cracker Barrel. The restaurant space itself is pretty so I give them points for style. Bottom line: Definitely not at the top of my list of places to go. There are much better places to Brunch at in STL",
